smtp4dev - the mail server for development

A dummy SMTP server for Windows. This repository hosts the development of v3 which will have a re-written web UI so that it can be shared amongst members of a team (the most requested feature in v2).
For downloads of the stable smtp4dev v2 please see [https://smtp4dev.codeplex.com/]
