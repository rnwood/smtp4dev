# ⚠️  SECURITY WARNING: The port configuration below publishes smtp4dev to ALL network interfaces.
# This means it may be accessible from outside your machine. For security, consider using:
#   - '127.0.0.1:5000:80'   # Web interface (localhost only)
#   - '127.0.0.1:25:25'     # SMTP server (localhost only)  
#   - '127.0.0.1:143:143'   # IMAP server (localhost only)
#   - '127.0.0.1:110:110'   # POP3 server (localhost only)
# See docs/Docker-Security.md for detailed security guidelines.
