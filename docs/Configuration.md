smtp4dev configuration can be performed via the `appsettings.json` file, environment variables and command-line arguments. 

## In the User Interface

**âœ¨Many of the basic settings can be edited in the UI** 

To configure, simply start up smtp4dev and click the settings icon at the top-right of the screen.

When saved, these are written to the settings file at `{AppData}/smtp4dev/appsettings.json`

## Configuration Files

You can find the default configuration file at `<installlocation>/appsettings.json`. This file is included in every release and will be overwritten when you update. To avoid this, create a 'user' configuration file at `{AppData}/smtp4dev/appsettings.json` and make your customisations there.

`{AppData}` is platform dependent but normally:
- Windows - environment variable: `APPDATA`
- Linux & Mac - environment variable: `XDG_CONFIG_HOME`

The search path of these files is printed when smtp4dev starts up. So the easiest way to find them is to look there:

```
smtp4dev version 3.3.6-ci20240419116+60aff5ea69aa19c6fb9afa8573fd5f77ab40de3a

User settings file: C:\Users\rob\AppData\Roaming\smtp4dev\appsettings.json
```

Version 3.1.2 onwards will automatically reload and apply any edits to the configuration file without restarting.

Note that this will vary by version of smtp4dev, so for best results, open the settings file you have!

## Environment Variables

All the values from `appsettings.json` can be overridden by environment variables.

Set environmment variables in the format: `ServerOptions__HostName`.

For arrays, use the format `ServerOptions__Users__0__User` where `Users` is the property holding the array, `0` is the index of the item and `User` is one of the properties of that item.

## Command Line Options

To see the command line options, run `Rnwood.Smtp4dev(.exe)` or `Rnwood.Smtp4dev.Desktop(.exe)` with `--help`.
