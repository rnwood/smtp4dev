smtp4dev configuration can be performed via the `appsettings.json` file, environment variables and command-line arguments. 

## In the User Interface

**âœ¨Many of the basic settings can be edited in the UI** 

To configure, simply start up smtp4dev and click the settings icon at the top-right of the screen.

When saved, these are written to the settings file at `{AppData}/smtp4dev/appsettings.json`

## Configuration Files

You can find the default configuration file at `<installlocation>/appsettings.json`. This file is included in every release and will be overwritten when you update. To avoid this, create a 'user' configuration file at `{AppData}/smtp4dev/appsettings.json` and make your customisations there.

`{AppData}` is platform dependent but normally:
- Windows - environment variable: `APPDATA`
- Linux & Mac - environment variable: `XDG_CONFIG_HOME`

The search path of these files is printed when smtp4dev starts up. So the easiest way to find them is to look there:

```
smtp4dev version 3.3.6-ci20240419116+60aff5ea69aa19c6fb9afa8573fd5f77ab40de3a
https://github.com/rnwood/smtp4dev
.NET Core runtime version: .NET 8.0.4

 > For help use argument --help

Install location: C:\Users\rob
DataDir: C:\Users\rob\AppData\Roaming\smtp4dev
Default settings file: C:\Users\rob\.dotnet\tools\.store\rnwood.smtp4dev\3.3.6-ci20240419116\rnwood.smtp4dev\3.3.6-ci20240419116\tools\net8.0\any\appsettings.json
User settings file: C:\Users\rob\AppData\Roaming\smtp4dev\appsettings.json
```

Version 3.1.2 onwards will automatically reload and apply any edits to the configuration file without restarting.

Note that this will vary by version of smtp4dev, so for best results, open the settings file you have!

## Environment Variables

All the values from `appsettings.json` can be overridden by environment variables.

Set environmment variables in the format: `ServerOptions__HostName`.

For arrays, use the format `ServerOptions__Users__0__User` where `Users` is the property holding the array, `0` is the index of the item and `User` is one of the properties of that item.

## Command Line Options

To see the command line options, run `Rnwood.Smtp4dev(.exe)` or `Rnwood.Smtp4dev.Desktop(.exe)` with `--help`.

## Mailbox Configuration

smtp4dev supports multiple virtual mailboxes to organize incoming messages. This is particularly useful for testing applications that send different types of emails.

### How Mailbox Routing Works

1. **Processing Order**: Mailboxes are processed in the order they appear in the configuration
2. **First Match Wins**: Each recipient is matched against mailbox recipient patterns, and the first match determines the destination
3. **Default Mailbox**: A default mailbox with `Recipients="*"` (catch-all) is automatically added as the last mailbox
4. **Single Delivery**: Each message is delivered only once to each mailbox, even if multiple recipients match the same mailbox

### Basic Mailbox Configuration

```json
{
  "ServerOptions": {
    "Mailboxes": [
      {
        "Name": "Sales",
        "Recipients": "*@sales.example.com, sales@*"
      },
      {
        "Name": "Support", 
        "Recipients": "support@*, help@*"
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

### Recipient Pattern Syntax

**Wildcards** (recommended for simple patterns):
- `*@example.com` - Any user at example.com
- `user@*` - Specific user at any domain  
- `*sales*@*` - Any address containing "sales"

**Regular Expressions** (for complex patterns, surround with `/`):
- `/.*@(sales|marketing)\.com$/` - Addresses ending with @sales.com or @marketing.com
- `/^(admin|root)@.*$/` - Addresses starting with admin@ or root@

### Preventing Default Mailbox Message Duplication

**Problem**: By default, messages matching custom mailboxes also appear in the default mailbox because it uses a catch-all pattern (`*`).

**Solution**: Configure the default mailbox explicitly with a negative regex to exclude recipients that should only go to specific mailboxes.

#### Example: Excluding Spam from Default Mailbox

```json
{
  "ServerOptions": {
    "Mailboxes": [
      {
        "Name": "Spam",
        "Recipients": "*spam*@*, *test*@*, *junk*@*"
      },
      {
        "Name": "Default", 
        "Recipients": "/^(?!.*(spam|test|junk)).*$/"
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

The negative regex `/^(?!.*(spam|test|junk)).*$/` means:
- `^` - Start of string
- `(?!.*(spam|test|junk))` - Negative lookahead: not containing spam, test, or junk
- `.*` - Match any characters
- `$` - End of string

#### Example: Department-Based Routing

```json
{
  "ServerOptions": {
    "Mailboxes": [
      {
        "Name": "Sales",
        "Recipients": "*@sales.company.com, sales@*"
      },
      {
        "Name": "Support",
        "Recipients": "*@support.company.com, support@*, help@*"
      },
      {
        "Name": "Development", 
        "Recipients": "*@dev.company.com, dev@*, developers@*"
      },
      {
        "Name": "Default",
        "Recipients": "/^(?!.*@(sales|support|dev)\\.company\\.com)(?!.*(sales|support|help|dev|developers)@).*$/"
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

### Advanced Configuration Tips

1. **Testing Patterns**: Use the SMTP sessions view in the web interface to see how recipients are being matched

2. **Case Sensitivity**: All pattern matching is case-insensitive

3. **Multiple Recipients**: When an email has multiple recipients, each recipient is processed independently and may go to different mailboxes

4. **Authenticated Users**: If `DeliverMessagesToUsersDefaultMailbox` is enabled and users are authenticated, messages go to the user's configured default mailbox instead of following recipient patterns

5. **Performance**: Wildcard patterns are generally faster than regular expressions for simple matching

### Troubleshooting

**Messages appear in multiple mailboxes**: Check if your default mailbox has a catch-all pattern. Use negative regex to exclude specific patterns.

**Messages not appearing in expected mailbox**: Verify the order of mailboxes - earlier mailboxes take precedence over later ones.

**Regex not working**: Ensure the pattern is surrounded by forward slashes (`/pattern/`) and test the regex with an online regex tester.
