# Enhanced Code Coverage Reports

This document describes the enhanced code coverage reporting implemented in the Azure DevOps pipeline for smtp4dev.

## Overview

The pipeline now generates more useful code coverage reports by:

1. **Namespace-level breakdown**: Groups coverage by namespace to show which parts of the codebase have good/poor coverage
2. **Visual indicators**: Uses color-coded badges (🟢🟡🔴) to quickly identify coverage levels
3. **Comprehensive details**: Shows line, branch, and method coverage for each namespace
4. **GitHub integration**: Posts enhanced reports as PR comments for easy visibility

## Features

### Enhanced GitHub Comments

The coverage report now includes:

- **Overall coverage summary** with color-coded status indicators
- **Namespace breakdown table** showing coverage metrics for each namespace
- **Class counts** per namespace to understand scope
- **Direct links** to detailed coverage reports in Azure DevOps

### Coverage Thresholds

Coverage badges are color-coded based on these thresholds:
- 🟢 **Green**: ≥80% coverage (Good)
- 🟡 **Yellow**: 60-79% coverage (Moderate) 
- 🔴 **Red**: <60% coverage (Needs improvement)

### Example Output

```markdown
## 📊 Code Coverage Report

| Coverage Type | Percentage | Status |
|---------------|------------|--------|
| Line Coverage | 71.3% | 🟡 |
| Branch Coverage | 61.7% | 🟡 |
| Method Coverage | 69% | 🟡 |

### 📁 Coverage by Namespace

| Namespace | Line Coverage | Branch Coverage | Method Coverage | Classes |
|-----------|---------------|-----------------|-----------------|---------|
| `Rnwood.SmtpServer` | 74.5% 🟡 | 68.2% 🟡 | 69.5% 🟡 | 43 |
| `Rnwood.SmtpServer.Extensions` | 74.2% 🟡 | 25% 🔴 | 91.3% 🟢 | 6 |
| `Rnwood.SmtpServer.Extensions.Auth` | 57.5% 🔴 | 48.8% 🔴 | 57.5% 🔴 | 23 |
| `Rnwood.SmtpServer.Verbs` | 100% 🟢 | 100% 🟢 | 100% 🟢 | 4 |
```

## Technical Implementation

### Pipeline Changes

The enhancement is implemented in the `ReportCoverage` stage of `azure-pipelines.yml`:

1. **Coverage data parsing**: Reads `Summary.json` generated by ReportGenerator
2. **Namespace grouping**: Extracts namespace information from class names
3. **Coverage calculation**: Aggregates line/branch/method coverage per namespace
4. **GitHub API integration**: Posts/updates PR comments with enhanced reports

### Namespace Extraction Logic

The script handles various class naming patterns:
- Simple classes: `Namespace.ClassName`
- Nested classes: `Namespace.ClassName/NestedClass`
- Multi-level namespaces: `Namespace.SubNamespace.ClassName`

### Future Enhancements

The pipeline includes preparation for PR delta reporting:

```powershell
# Future enhancement: Download base branch coverage for comparison
# To implement PR deltas:
# 1. Get base branch name: $(System.PullRequest.TargetBranch)
# 2. Download artifact from latest successful build on base branch
# 3. Compare current vs base coverage using enhanced script logic
# 4. Add delta columns to namespace table and overall summary
```

## Benefits

1. **Better visibility**: Developers can quickly identify which namespaces need testing attention
2. **Focused effort**: Coverage gaps are clearly highlighted by namespace
3. **Progress tracking**: Visual indicators make it easy to see improvement trends
4. **Actionable insights**: Namespace-level detail helps prioritize testing efforts

## Configuration

The enhanced reporting is automatically enabled for all PRs when:
- The `GITHUB_TOKEN` environment variable is configured
- Coverage data is successfully collected during test runs
- The `ReportCoverage` stage executes for PR builds

No additional configuration is required - the enhancement works with the existing coverage collection infrastructure.
